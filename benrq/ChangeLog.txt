version 20070601:

	Remove dbpf-recompress's dependency on unistd.h.

	Check for out-of-range file offsets and lengths when
		opening a DBPF file.

version 20070530:

	dbpf_write now refuses to write a file with duplicate
		entries in the index.

	A new write disposition, dbpf_write_skip, causes an entry
		to be ignored.

	A new function dbpf_compare_entries does a lexicographical
		compare of the type/group/instance of two entries.

	Unsigned numbers changed to int. Non-numbers like
		type/group/instance ids are still unsigned.

	Removed all gotos.

	Various code cleanup so that everything builds without
		warnings on g++.

	Replaced a few lingering tab characters with spaces.

	dbpf-recompress:

		Used to print garbage in certain cases when
			verification failed; fixed.

		Now prints a slightly better error message for a
			read past end-of-file.

		Include <unistd.h> only on Unix-ish systems.
