/*
 * Opens a DBPF file. Uses read/write callbacks so that it's not bound to
 * some particular file access model; I hate libraries that force you to
 * use stdio.
 *
 * The read callback should succeed, returning a nonnegative number, only
 * if the entire read request is satisfied; no partial reads. It should
 * fail otherwise, returning a negative number and setting the error string.
 *
 * The write callback should succeed except in unusual circumstances (like
 * disk full). Writes past the end of the file should succeed, increasing
 * the file length. A length of zero is a special case: it should truncate
 * the file at the given position. The write callback can be NULL if you're
 * not planning on doing any writing.
 *
 * The close callback is called by dbpf_open if the open fails; otherwise
 * it's called by dbpf_close.
 *
 * dbpf_open returns NULL on failure. If the failure was caused by a
 * negative return from a callback, *error will contain whatever the
 * callback put in it; otherwise it will contain an English error message.

 * enough to fit. In the case of a 0 return, the file is left unmodified.

/*
 * Rewrites the file based on the new index you provide. This is a safe
 * update: if it fails (negative return), the archive is still valid with
 * all its old contents intact. This means that it can't overwrite
 * anything, so the file size may double if you rewrite the whole thing.
 * This is fine for development. For distribution you should recompress
 * the whole file anyway (see dbpf-recompress.cpp).
 *
 * If the function succeeds, the old index is invalid and you should call
 * dbpf_get_entry_count and dbpf_get_entries again.
 *
 * This uses a callback for the data, rather than a pointer in dbpf_entry,
 * so that it doesn't all need to be in memory at once. The callback can
 * reuse the same buffer for each call. The callback will only be called
 * for index entries that don't specify dbpf_write_keep_existing. The
 * callback can fail (returning NULL) which causes the function to fail.
 *
 * Do not include an entry of type 0xE86B1EEF (compressed file directory).
 * The function will fail if you do.
